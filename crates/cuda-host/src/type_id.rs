//! Stable 128-bit type identifiers for kernel PTX naming.
//!
//! The host needs to compute the same per-type hash that the backend computes
//! via `tcx.type_id_hash(ty).as_u128()`. The stable [`core::any::TypeId::of`]
//! API would force a `T: 'static` bound on the kernel marker, which would in
//! turn reject perfectly valid non-`'static` borrowing closures (e.g. a kernel
//! launcher capturing `&[f32]` from a stack frame the caller keeps alive
//! across the launch). The `core::intrinsics::type_id` form has bound
//! `T: ?Sized` — i.e. no `'static` requirement — and produces the exact same
//! 128-bit value that `tcx.type_id_hash` does for that type, because both go
//! through the same `erase_and_anonymize_regions` + stable-hash pipeline.
//!
//! In practice the macro layer calls this with a *tuple* type
//! `(T0, T1, ...,)` so the on-wire PTX name is a single 32-char hex chunk
//! regardless of the kernel's generic arity (see
//! `crates/cuda-macros/src/lib.rs::generate_generic_cuda_kernel_impl`).
//!
//! Framing note for future contributors: `core::intrinsics::type_id` is an
//! internal API and requires `#![feature(core_intrinsics)]` on the owning
//! crate. cuda-oxide already ships against `rustc_private` and pins a
//! nightly toolchain, so this is inside our existing risk surface — but the
//! helper cannot be lifted into a stable-feeling utility crate without
//! re-introducing the feature gate there.

use core::any::TypeId;

/// Returns the same 128-bit hash that the cuda-oxide backend uses for
/// kernel export names.
///
/// At runtime the value is just the 16 raw hash bytes (see the layout
/// comment in `core::any::TypeId`). The intrinsic is const-evaluated by
/// rustc using its internal `Ty<'tcx>` representation, so the call site
/// only ever sees a constant `u128`.
///
/// Bound is intentionally `T: ?Sized` (not `T: 'static`). The typed launch
/// path must keep accepting non-`'static` borrowing closures, the same way
/// the legacy `type_name`-based path did. Adding `'static` here would
/// silently tighten the typed API without enforcing the actual launch-
/// outlives-borrow invariant — that responsibility still sits with the
/// caller (the borrow must outlive `stream.synchronize()`).
