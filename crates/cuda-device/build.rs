//! Expose the compute-capability floor to device code as `cfg`s.
//!
//! Device code has no way to ask what target it is being compiled for, so an
//! API with a faster form on newer hardware -- `redux.sync` in place of a
//! shuffle tree, for one -- either always pays for the portable form or asks
//! every caller to gate the choice by hand. A `cfg` is decided before rustc
//! runs, so rustc drops the branch that does not apply and the requirement
//! scan never sees an instruction the target cannot run.
//!
//! Because a `cfg` is fixed before compilation it can only carry a *lower*
//! bound: the floor is the lowest capability the resulting PTX will be built
//! for, never the exact device. `CUDA_OXIDE_TARGET` sets it exactly, since
//! that is what gets built. `CUDA_OXIDE_DEVICE_ARCH` can only lower it: the
//! backend builds for the detected device when that device can run the kernel
//! and otherwise for the arch the kernel requires, so it bounds how low
//! selection may go, not how high. The rule lives in `cuda-target-spec` and is
//! shared with the backend's own target selection rather than restated here,
//! so the two cannot disagree about what the floor is.
